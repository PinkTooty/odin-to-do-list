I was meant to create this project using webpack and modules because I thought it'd be easier to program some logic on one file then move them all into modules as needed.
But as I tried to do just that, I just ended up with too many errors that was too much work to deal with. 
Thus, no javascript modules were used in this project.
I did however, learn a lot during this project and I know how to use webpack to my advantage now.
Note to self: organize your code every now and then.
Must run npm run --watch to get it to work
